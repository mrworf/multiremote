# This is the suggested configuration format for multiRemote but not yet
# implemented.
#
# Uses a more natural language to make it easier to configure and understand
# what it does.
#
# Empty lines or lines starting with hash are ignored. The use of indentation
# is optional, but helps with readability.
#
# All options are case insensitive and will be lower-case unless they are to
# be presented to the end-user (such as descriptions or names).
